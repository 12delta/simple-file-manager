simple-file-manager
===================
This is update for Simple PHP file manager that also includes a Markdown and text editor.

Just copy files to a folder on your webserver.

- `editor.php`
- `css/*`
- `fonts/*`
- `js/*`

## Why it is good

- Ajax based so it is fast, but doesn't break the back button
- Allows drag and drop file uploads if folder is writable by the webserver
- Suits my aesthetics.  More like Dropbox, and less like Windows Explorer
- Works with Unicode file names
- The interface is usable from an iPad
- XSRF protection (though no authentication system)
- Includes the Markdown editor [SimpleMDE](https://simplemde.com/) (including its dependencies)

## Features
- Browse file
- Download file
- File removing
- File editing
- Markdown file editing
- Folder zip
- Unzip
- Rename
